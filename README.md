Logging is affected by the disk IO and pipe system call.
Sequential log calls can be a bottleneck in scenarios where low
latency is critical (e.g., high-frequency trading).

`ftlog` mitigates this bottleneck by sending messages to a dedicated logger
thread and computing as little as possible in the main/worker thread.

`ftlog` can improve log performance in main/worker thread a few times over. See
performance for details.


## Usage

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
ftlog = "0.2"
```

Configure and initialize ftlog at the start of your `main` function:
```rust
// ftlog re-export `log`'s macros, so no need to add `log` to dependencies
use ftlog::appender::FileAppender;
use ftlog::{debug, trace};
use log::{error, info, warn};

// minimal configuration with default setting
ftlog::builder().try_init().unwrap();

trace!("Hello world!");
debug!("Hello world!");
info!("Hello world!");
warn!("Hello world!");
error!("Hello world!");
```

A more complicated but feature rich usage:

```rust
use ftlog::{
    appender::{Duration, FileAppender, Period},
    FtLogFormatter, LevelFilter,
};

// configurate logger
let logger = ftlog::builder()
    // global max log level
    .max_log_level(LevelFilter::Info)
    // global log formatter, timestamp is fixed for performance
    .format(FtLogFormatter)
    // use bounded channel to avoid large memory comsumption when overwhelmed with logs
    // Set `false` to tell ftlog to discard excessive logs.
    // Set `true` to block log call to wait for log thread.
    // here is the default settings
    .bounded(100_000, false) // .unbounded()
    // define root appender, pass anything that is Write and Send
    // omit `Builder::root` will write to stderr
    .root(FileAppender::rotate_with_expire(
        "./current.log",
        Period::Day,
        Duration::days(7),
    ))
    // Do not convert to local timezone for timestamp, this does not affect worker thread,
    // but can boost log thread performance (higher throughput).
    .utc()
    // level filter for root appender
    .root_log_level(LevelFilter::Warn)
    // write logs in ftlog::appender to "./ftlog-appender.log" instead of "./current.log"
    .filter("ftlog::appender", "ftlog-appender", LevelFilter::Error)
    .appender("ftlog-appender", FileAppender::new("ftlog-appender.log"))
    .try_init()
    .expect("logger build or set failed");
```

See `./examples` for more (e.g. custom format).

### Default Log Format

The datetime format is fixed for performance reasons.

> 2022-04-08 19:20:48.190+08 **298ms** INFO main [src/ftlog.rs:14] My log
> message

Here `298ms` denotes the latency between the call of the log (e.g.
`log::info!("msg")`) and the actual printing in log thread. Normally this is 0ms.

A large delay indicates that the log thread may be blocked by excessive log
messages.

> 2022-04-10 21:27:15.996+08 0ms **2** INFO main [src/main.rs:29] limit
> running3 !

The number **2** above indicates how many log messages were discarded.
Only shown if the frequency of logging for a single log call is limited (e.g.
`log::info!(limit=3000;"msg")`).

### Log with interval

`ftlog` allows to limit the write frequency for individual log calls.

If the above line is called multiple times within 3000ms, then it is logged only
once, with an added number reflecting the number of discarded log messages.

Each log call ha an independent interval, so we can set different intervals
for different log calls. Internally, `ftlog` records the last print time by a
combination of (module name, file name, code line).

#### Example

```rust
info!(limit=3000; "limit running {}s !", 3);
```
The minimal interval of the the specific log call above is 3000ms.

```markdown
2022-04-10 21:27:10.996+08 0ms 0 INFO main [src/main.rs:29] limit running 3s !
2022-04-10 21:27:15.996+08 0ms 2 INFO main [src/main.rs:29] limit running 3s !
```
The number **2** above shows how many log messages is discarded since last log.

### Log rotation
`ftlog` supports log rotation in local timezone. The available rotation
periods are:

- minute `Period::Minute`
- hour `Period::Hour`
- day `Period::Day`
- month `Period::Month`
- year `Period::Year`

Log rotation is configured in `FileAppender`, and the timestamp is appended to
the end of the filename:

```rust
use ftlog::appender::{FileAppender, Period};

let logger = ftlog::builder()
    .root(FileAppender::rotate("./mylog.log", Period::Minute))
    .build()
    .unwrap();
logger.init().unwrap();
```

If the log file is configued to be split by minutes,
the log file name has the format
`mylog-{MMMM}{YY}{DD}T{hh}{mm}.log`. When divided by days, the log file name is
something like `mylog-{MMMM}{YY}{DD}.log`.

Log filename examples:
```sh
$ ls
# by minute
current-20221026T1351.log
# by hour
current-20221026T13.log
# by day
current-20221026.log
# by month
current-202210.log
# by year
current-2022.log
# omitting extension (e.g. "./log") will add datetime to the end of log filename
log-20221026T1351
```

#### Clean outdated logs

With log rotation enabled, it is possible to clean outdated logs to free up
disk space with `FileAppender::rotate_with_expire` method.

`ftlog` first finds files generated by `ftlog` and cleans outdated logs by
last modified time. `ftlog` find generated logs by filename matched by file
stem and added datetime.

**ATTENTION**: Any files that matchs the pattern will be deleted.

```rust
use ftlog::{appender::{Period, FileAppender, Duration}};

// clean files named like `current-\d{8}T\d{4}.log`.
// files like `another-\d{8}T\d{4}.log` or `current-\d{8}T\d{4}` will not be deleted, since the filenames' stem do not match.
// files like `current-\d{8}.log` will remains either, since the rotation durations do not match.

// Rotate every day, clean stale logs that were modified 7 days ago on each rotation
let appender = FileAppender::rotate_with_expire("./current.log", Period::Day, Duration::days(7));
let logger = ftlog::builder()
    .root(appender)
    .build()
    .unwrap();
logger.init().unwrap();
```

## Features
- **tsc**
  Use [TSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter) for clock source for higher performance without
  accuracy loss.

  TSC offers the most accurate and cheapest way to access current time under certain condition:
  1. the CPU frequency must be constant
  1. must with CPU of x86/x86_64 architecture, since TSC is an x86/x86_64 specific register.
  1. never suspend

  The current feature further requires that the build target **MUST BE LINUX**. Otherwise it will fall back to
  a fast but much less accurate implementation.

## Timezone

For performance, timezone is detected once at logger buildup, and use it later in every
log message. This is partly due to timezone detetion is expensive, and partly to the unsafe
nature of underlying system call in multi-thread program in Linux.

It's also recommended to use UTC instead to further avoid timestamp convertion to timezone for every log message.
